# TDD

In this project we built a couple of classes that perform simple operations using TDD.

## Built With

- Ruby.
- Linters.

## Install

- Install Ruby based on your OS from [HERE](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

## Setup

1. Clone the project using git-bash or Githup Desktop.
2. Open the project folder with VSCode or any Editor.
3. Open terminal and navigate to the project folder.
4. Type `irb`.
5. Copy the code from files and run it.
6. Alternatively, you can run the code executing the `ruby` + `file_name` (e.g. `ruby solver.rb`) command in your terminal.
7. If you want to run some unit tests, all you need to do is run the `rspec` command on your terminal after executing the `gem install rspec` command.
